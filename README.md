## Comments on UI/UX and additional comments
I really like the color palette using black and white and a grayscale,
I associate this greatly with the simplicity of riding a bicycle and it significantly highlights the utility and simplicity of the interface.

You will find 3 views within the src/views folder, each view shows a section of the page.
you will also find in src/components the list of used components.
you will also find both static and dynamic components
the static components will be plain HTML content without any logic.
whereas the dynamic ones will use pinia as a store manager, this is used in a very simple manner, simulating an API
you will also find very simple logic, it really serves to illustrate the functionality of the component in a simple way.

###please review this folders
src/components
src/views
src/stores
